Part 1: The Birth of a Mistake 
Chapter 1

It all started on a magnificent afternoon, in May of 2019, 9th grade. Tasked with an insurmountable task, we coalesced as the first version of Les Accidents, counting as members Mathieu Denis Joseph Carrière, Adib Charba and Ali-Hassan Qureshi. Now grouped together, we set on our quest to successfully conquer the art project (and perhaps commit a felony or two along the way.) This goal was met with resounding success, as we got at least a 60% on our test final. After the fact of the art exam, we kept the group chat as a group chat Ft. Da sexy dudes. A normal day in Les Accidents would typically have furry references, roblox gifs, thanos, or at the very least the departure of Mathieu only to ask to get reinvited an hour later. This cycle continued in our daily commute during the summer of 2019. 


Chapter 2
10th grade began with Les Accidents and its occasional conversations proceeding smoothly. One day, in an attempt to bring new spirits in the group chat, a young man was added, however this one was too invested in his love life. “L’amour, c’est du chocolat,” said he, as he sinned more than Diego in Dora and the Lost City of Gold. According to Health Blog, “chocolate has [traditionally] been viewed as a potential trigger for gut symptoms like pain, cramping, bloating, gas and diarrhea,” thereby explaining many things. As such, Ali-Hassan, hitherto coming to Mathieu’s house for the history project, consumed a notable quantity of chocolate, in order to stain the bathroom walls RED with his INNARDS, thus establishing the well-known Saison de l’amour. After this traumatic episode, Jacob was formally invited to join the delegation of Les Accidents, and gracefully accepted the offer, promptly saying “Bro wtf” following a suspicious visual novel screenshot by the legend himself, visual novel man, as his first message.

what is going on? asked Johnny Test. “it’s nothing” replied the incarnation of obesity, Bling Bling Boy.
